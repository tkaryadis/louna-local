Clojars [[louna/louna-local "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]](https://clojars.org/louna/louna-local)  
Documentation [https://tkaryadis.github.io/louna-local](https://tkaryadis.github.io/louna-local)  

Project is for educational purposes,it contains  
1)Query language similar to SPARQL but with Lispy syntax  
2)Query processor,joins/groupby/sortby/etc  
  A large part of SPARQL language is supported.  
3)RDF transformations,rdf files are transformed to louna  
  files to be queried  
4)SPARQL generation  
  Louna queries can generate SPARQL to query  

For a faster implementation look at [[louna/louna-spark "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]](https://clojars.org/louna/louna-spark)  
That is a Clojure spark library with similar to louna-local syntax,that runs on Apache Spark so its very fast.   

## Examples
Most of the examples are solution to this book
