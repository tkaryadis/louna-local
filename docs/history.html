<b>17 February -24 February 2018</b>
   joins (partially implemented)
   variable binding
   first demo 
  
   Here all relations was on memory,not all join types were implemented.
   Relation join was executed in the order the user wrote them.
   Query was using strings "?v" instead of ?v ,it was first demo.

<b>24 February - 24 March 2018</b>
   rebuild the demo  
   projections
   filter  
   bind 

   This was the first big change,relations was read loaded in memory one
   by one,order was decided,embedded in code (not yet query plan).
   Filter and binds were working(filters was very slow back then)

<b>24 March - 31 March 2018</b>
   debug joins with circles
   read rdf and store them to louna readable form (1 relation/file)    
   namespaces support   
   query rdf   
   16 example queries in query.clj

   Testing for the first louna edition,with some RDF data,triplestore
   foundations,of how to translate RDF data.

<b>1 April - 8 April 2018</b>
   bug fixes     
   group support/recursive groups       
   remake macroq macro to support groups       
   union        
   example queries with unions

   Groups support,make union and make louna capable to handle groups.
   Groups at that time were written in a complicated way,because no
   auto-grouping was used back then,so user made the groups inside the query.

<b>9 April - 16 April 2018</b>     
   optional     
   minus    
   join tables    
   bind tables    
   filter tables    
   examples

   Building more group operators.

<b>17 April - 24 April 2018</b>          
   sort-by                 
   aggregation functions   
   group by       
   having    
   make-doc(doc/0,1,2,3)   

   Building more group operators.
   Start documenting the site to show what louna can do.

<b>24 April - 30 April 2018</b>      
   remake-packages/file-names        
   limit    
   auto-testing     
   make-doc(doc/4.1,4.2,5,6)        
   minor bug fixes (namespaces in filter binds)   
   minor performance fixes (values in atom)   

   Re-organize source code,make auto-testing with that time like 50 
   queries to run the test's and find errors when i made differences.
   50 queries auto test=> shows which failed if fail

<b>1 May - 8 May 2018</b>   
   rebuild BGP package to support:
     1) query plan    
     2) cost based optimization of the query plan
     
   query->query plan->optimization->execute    

   Query plan was so important,the code was so difficult to understand
   query plan was embedded in code,making it so complicated.
   Query plan was made,and the code followed the query plan.

   Also cost based optimization was made.No cartesians,and smaller 
   relations first in join order.

<b>9 May - 16 May 2018</b>     
   testing &amp; debugging (BGP package rebuild)      
   queries with var on relation (?r ...)       
   property paths (Inverse path, alternative paths, sequence paths)  

   Relation with ?r wasn't made until then,actually without the query plan
   i tried to implement them and failed.It was hard.But with query plan
   was was happening was visible and everything was alot easier.

   Also added property paths


<b>17 May - 24 May 2018</b>     
   BGP (autogrouping, cartesian filters, binds etc.)   
   property paths (path+)            
   read from multiple rdf files (many rdf files make 1 db)  
   bug fixes (remake optional, test-queries fix namespace bug, regular expressions bug, eval bug when number)   

   Louna was not simple,user had to write the groups manually,autogrouping was needed
   (see internals/autogrouping)
   Also added the ability on triplestore to read many rdf files and make 1 database from all.

<b>25 May - 1 June 2018</b>  
   add-types (free types in memory, not just strings)        
   default-namespaces/default databases      
   path*   
   performance fix(not read-string->eval,just eval)(done)            
   add more test queries             
   construct 

   This was important also,at first editions of louna,all data was string in tables.
   And strings were made to numbers to apply filter and binds.
   But louna is a data processing tool,and had to deal with all types.
   In louna at least in memory DB you can store everything.When you save it to text
   files it has to be something printable to string.

   Fixed the functions in queries(1st fix,see Internals/functions on queries)
   Started building constructs


<b>1 June - 10 June 2018</b> 
   construct with queries
   nested constructs and queries
   q-in q-out and multiple in sources/out sources         

   Constructs and nested construct/queries.
   Fixing input and output {:q-in [] ...}

<b>June 10 - 17 June 2018</b>           
   update docs      
   make docs website          
   testing          
   more examples   
   project completed (docs website + code)

   Starting the website.


<b>June 18 - 26</b>   
   Benchmarking performance
   Web-site additions.

   Learn how to use Jena and start benchmarks with Clojure
   
<b>June 18 - 4 July </b>   
   Remake function queries,second fix solutions see Internals/functions on queries.
   Filters was terrible slow back then.
   Website updates,general performance and bug fixes.

<b>July 4 - 15 July </b> 
   Only some days in that 10 days worked with louna,and make SPARQL generation.
   At least the fundation.
   At first i didn't know how to do it , but then i found the way,using macros
   that can have nested macros.

<b>July 15 - September 5</b>
   Louna was frozen.
   I studied for semptember exams.
   I did'nt want to make them both because i would prefer louna.

<b>September 6 - September 15 </b>
   Rebuild gen-sparql,to suppport variadic macros,to support many functions.
   Update web-site
   Bug fixing
   Adding examples.

<b>September 15 - October 4 </b>
   Site formatting,add more content.
   Bug fixes.
   Cleaning code.
   Change code structure.
   RDF from constructs. (:rdf "my-dir")

<b>October 4 - October 13</b>
   At september i didn't want to change the code alot,so i left it.
   And i did mostly web-site thigs and cleaning-debugging.
   But i changed my mind and i started coding again,because iwanted
   to make the alternative join method.

   Made join method 1
   Used temp-vars to have only 1 relation type (rso)
   And then spend time to update the site,debug them,and benchmark them.
   Materialiaze construct

   Join method 1 is like 20% slower that join Method 2,but its more simple
   in code.I think its fixable to go faster than Method 2.

<b>October 14 -...</b>
Testing and website updates.
