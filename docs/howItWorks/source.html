Brief usage of every .clj file,in every package

*Better to read it again after you read query plan,bgp and groups in internals documentation
 or read it while reading them

<b>louna</b>
    louna.louna.clj
        Contains 2 basic macros q and c.Its the file that the user will import
        to their project so he can query/produce constructs.
        Also has 2 basic functions run-q and run-q,that take the results of
        the corresponding macros and runs the query/construct
    louna.louna_util.clj
        The user also imports that file it has some useful functions that
        he maybe need when using louna,like db-to-nt,that converts a louna
        database to an .nt rdf file

<b>macroq</b>
    This package has all the functions that macroq is using to make the
    query valid clojure code,and also make some transformations of the query.
    macroq.q_process.clj
        It has the basic recursive function add-str-group that parses the
        query.Its main purpose is to produce valid clojure code.
        Also it calls functions from the other files in the packages 
        explaned below
    macroq.q-process-triples.clj
        It process triples for example the triples(not clojure code)
        (:meal.cost ?meal ?cost)
        ((+ ?cost  ?tip) ?totalcost)
        (<= ?totalcost  20)
        Will be converted to normal clojure code
        [1 :meal.cost "?meal" "?cost"]
        [2 "totalcost" "(+ \"?cost\"  \"?tip\" )"]
        [3 "(<= \"?totalcost\"  20)"]
        *1 triple,2 bind,3 filter
    macroq.q_rewrite.clj
        it changes the query for example it add missing operators that
        are implied like :and(join operator)
        also is used in property paths to rewrite the query
    macroq.q_process_op_args.clj
        the table operators,for example project/sort-by/group-by etc
        have arguments,that are not valid clojure code also,some processing
        is done to make them valid clojure code and some transformations also
    macroq.q_autogroup.clj
        the user when he writes the query he is not bothered to group things
        together louna makes automatically the groups.More details for that
        in the Autogrouping in internals documentation

<b>groups</b>
    Now we have the query ready to run for example this is a example output
    of q macro its valid clojure code
    [["__and__" [1 :meal.cost "?meal" "?cost"]
                [1 :meal.type "?meal" "dinner"]
                [1 :meal.name "?meal" "?name"]
                [2 "tip" "(* \"?cost\"  0.1)"]
                [2 "totalcost" "(+ \"?cost\"  \"?tip\" )"]
                [3 "(<= \"?totalcost\"  20)"]]
     ["__project__" ["name" "totalcost"] [] -1]]

    groups.group_run.clj
        this is the main file of the package that has the recursive 
        function that runs the groups    
        The table is calculated nested and top-to bottom(like sparql)
        You think of a table goes down and operations are applied to it.
        In the process many bgp might be run,and many table operators
        (binary or unary may be applied)
        In the above example there is a BGP group that after it calculated
        the unary table operator project will be applied to it
    groups.table_unary_op.clj
        :table
        :sort-by
        :group-by
        :project
        :do
        :do-each
        Contains all the code to apply unary operation on tables,like
        in our example the project
    groups.table_binary_op.clj
        :and (join ,implied)
        :add (UNION)
        :not (MINUS)
        :if  (OPTIONAL)
        Contains all the code to apply binary operation on tables,in our
        example :and is used with first argument the empty table that
        coming for "above" and th BGP that is produced,so the results its
        just the BGP 
    
<b>bgp</b>
    bgp=triples and optional binds filters,that will become 1 table
    bgp contains the files responsible for a bgp like the above to become
    a table.While groups.group_run runs,if it finds a BGP it calls the
    bgp.run-bgp to run it (actually bgp_process and bgp_proces run bgp_run)

    bgp.bgp_process
       seperates the bgp to relational queries(triples) filters and binds
       and uses bgp-run to run the bgp (uses the numbers 1,2,3 the the triple
       have)

    bgp.bgp-run
       main file in the package,uses all the other files to make the
       final table

    bgp.filter-process
       The filters of the BGP needs to be processed,the easiest way would be to just do the joins
       and then apply the filter,but this could cause serious speed and memory problems
       The filters must be applied the sooner as possible.
       The filters are seperated in 2 categories 
           relation filters
               those are used when reading a relation
               for example (name ?id ?lastname) (= ?lastname "kariadis")
               you apply it when you read the relation(before the join)
           join filters
               those are used when joining relations,you cant  used them any sooner
               (name ?id ?lastname) 
               (name ?id ?country)
               (and (= ?country "Greece") (= ?lastname "kariadis"))
               when we have ?country and ?lastname in the table we are ready to apply it while 
               joining the relations based on the query plan
               this is done by having each filter a trigger var,for the above filter the trigger
               var would be the one that added last on the table ?country or ?lastname    
    
    bgp.filter-run
        functions to run the filters and deside if the line will
        be added in the table or not
        2 basic functions  
            run-vars-filters-vectors(relation filters run) 
            run-table-filter-vectors(join filters run)
    
    bgp.binds_process
        takes the bind queries and process the binds,for example what variables
        the bind needs to calculate the new value.
        a bind can be added when we have in the table the variables that it
        needs for example ((+ ?cost  ?tip) ?totalcost) can be added to the
        table when we have ?cost and ?tip on the table.
        if ?tip is the last variable(based on the table header that we will
        produce),the the bind belongs to the relation that adds the ?tip 
        variable in the table
        binds belongs to the relationship that adds the last variable they need
        based on the table header
        also binds can have filters applied to them
        relation
           filters on relation
           binds on relation
              filters on binds
        *see query plan for more about this

    bgp.functions_process
        this is very basic file because its used to convert the strings 
        of clojure code in filters and in binds to clojure functions and  
        run it,for example run code that is like that
        "(<= \"?totalcost\" 20)"
        the totalcost value comes from the table and the code is run
        Details of how it does it on internals functions on queries
              
      
    bgp.binds-run
        run the code of the bind to calculate the new values for the new bind-var
    
    
    bgp.relations_process
        Relations are seperated based on their type(?r ?s ?o),every relation
        takes inside the filters the binds that used in it.
        Every triple becomes a map like this
        relation          {"query" query
                              "type" "s/o/so/rso/rs/ro/r"
                              "relation" relation
                              "s-var/o-var/pair/triple"
                              "filters" {}
                              "vars" #{}}
        s  =>? on subject
        so =>? on subject and object 
        etc
        its information about the relation that will be used to know which 
        binds belongs to it etc

    bgp.joins_process.clj
        This is very basic file also,its used to make the query plan.
        The query plan also defines the order of the vars in the header
        of the table.
        Based on the order of header the join filters and the binds are
        applied.As said above when the last var the filter or bind need is
        on the table the bind or the join filter can be applied

        The query plan has a basic optimizer that selects the smallest
        relations(based on line count) to joined first


<b>bgp-joins</b>

  Join method 1
    
  bgp-joins.joins_run
    Reads the query plan and call functions to make the joins.

  bgp-joins.relations_run
    Makes the joins.Takes the hash-table,join,and produce the next hash-table
    based on the next-join-vars.
  
  bgp-joins.relations_run_filter
    Runs the relations that dont add any new variables,they are just
    filter-relations.     

<b>bgp-joins-disk</b>

   Join method 2
   bgp-joins-disk.joins_run
        Processing is now over,we now the order of the vars in the table
        the order of the joins,which filter would be applied when reading
        relations,which will be applied when joining and when.
        Also we know all the information when to run the binds.
        Everything the query plan says to us.
        Now its time to actually make the joins based on query plan
        It contains 2 basic functions
            bgp.joins-run/init-table
            bgp.joins-run/make-joins
        The one initialize the table(with the first relation)
        And the other makes the joins
        *More about this on the internals BGP

   bgp-joins-disk.relations_run_shared
        This contains functions shared by 
        relations_run_init
        relations_run_join
        bgp.relations_run_filter
        

   bgp-joins-disk.relations_run_filter
        Some triples don't add a new variable on the table they are just 
        filters for example
        (:employers.name  ?id ?name)
        (:greeks.name     ?id ?name)
        If we have a company with foreign and greek employers we could 
        filter the non-greeks with this 2 triples.
        The second triple doesn't add any variable on the table its only
        a filter.And this file is used to run triples that are filters

    bgp-joins-disk.relations_run_init
        read the first relation that initialize the table apply filters
        and binds also

    bgp-joins-disk.relations_run_join
        read the relation that will produce a join  
  
    bgp-joins-disk.path_run_seq_star_plus
        This runs the property paths like  knows+ knows* 
 
    For example if its join,the relation returns in a hash-map with the
    join variable as key,if it is init table the relation return as
    lines of the table,if it is run-filter the relation returns as 
    hash-set 

    So far the packages and files to run a query are explained.
    The rest are untility files and files for contructs and to generate
    sparql

<b>macroc</b>
    As we said louna contains the macro c,that uses functions from 
    macroc.process to process the construct,and then the construct is
    ready to run by run-c(inside the louna file)
    run-c uses functions from macroc.c_run
   
    macroc.c_process (used by macro c to produce valid clojure code)
    macroc.c_run     (used by run-c function to run the construct)
    macroc.c_save    (saves constructs to disk)
    macroc.c_rdf_in  (reads rdf files (:rdf "my_dir"))
    macroc.rdf_out   (generates .nt file from a database,louna->rdf)
    


<b>macroql</b>
    The package that generates SPARQL from louna query.
    
    macroql.to_sparql
        transforms a louna qury to SPARQL query
    macroql.sparql_f
        contains all the macros that mimic clojure functions that produce
        SPARQL functions
        the macros can be nested or with variadic arguments

<b>library</b>
    library.until
        small utility functions that used by many clojure files

    library.print_data
        functions to print data like tables,relations,query plan etc

<b>state </b>
    state.db_settings
        holds information like for example where is the directory that
        we read relations,also reads the file that tells where is this directory

    state.state
        louna is almost stateless,state complicates things,its only used
        for counters to generate names,or counters for new table lines etc
