<h5 class = "main-title">BGP</h5>
Basic graph pattern in SPARQL terminology is a 1 group containing only 
triples and optinal local binds filters on the vars of the group.

We will go function by function(at least the important ones)
The example is simple but its enough to understand what louna does
in general.

Query example
(test/documentation.internals:32)

<div class="code">
(def menuDB {:meal.name
             [[1 "eggs with potatoes"]
              [2 "fried rice with eggs"]
              [3 "chicken soup"]
              [4 "shrimp soup"]
              [5 "pasta bolonese"]
              [6 "pizza"]]

             :meal.type
             [[1 "breakfast"]
              [2 "lunch"]
              [3 "lunch"]
              [4 "dinner"]
              [5 "dinner"]
              [6 "dinner"]]

             :meal.cost
             [[1 6.5]
              [2 11]
              [3 20]
              [4 28]
              [5 19.5]
              [6 12]]
             })

(q {:q-in [menuDB] :q-out ["print"]}

   [?name ?totalcost]
   (:meal.type ?meal "dinner")
   (:meal.name ?meal ?name)
   (:meal.cost ?meal ?cost)
   ((* ?cost 0.1)    ?tip)
   ((+ ?cost ?tip)   ?totalcost)
   (<= ?totalcost 20))

</div>
(defmacro q [& queries])   louna.louna.clj:84
    q is a macro,the macro is used because the arguments are not valid clojure code
    for example ?meal is not a clojure variable with a value,its an undefined symbol.
    (macros dont evaluate their arguments,they read them like symbols
     not like vars)

    We need the macro to take the not clojure code,and produce clojure code.
    The macro runs at compile time.The output of the macro is clojure code.
    The output is a call to a clojure function,but with arguments valid clojure code.
    The output of the macro will run at runtime.

<div class="code">
    (run-q {}
           {:q-in [menuDB], :q-out ["print"]}
           [["__and__" [1 :meal.cost "?meal" "?cost"]
                       [1 :meal.type "?meal" "dinner"]
                       [1 :meal.name "?meal" "?name"]
                       [2 "tip" "(* \"?cost\"  0.1)"]
                       [2 "totalcost" "(+ \"?cost\"  \"?tip\" )"]
                       [3 "(<= \"?totalcost\"  20)"]]
            ["__project__" ["name" "totalcost"] [] -1]]
           {})
</div>
    The first {} means that the query don't have any clojure variable for example instead
    of 20 we could use a local variable to make the query more general.
    (more on this on Functions in querie in internal documentation)

    The second map is about the input and output,it will be used to know where to read from
    here the in-memory database,and where to store the results,here we only print them.

    The last {} means that we dont have any nested construct for example its not 
    (q ...
       (c ...))

    The important is the  [["__and__" ...]]  which is the basic part of the query,the BGP.
    The last one project is a unary operator that will be applied to the table that the BGP will produce.
    ["__project__" ["name" "totalcost"] [] -1] means keep only "name" and "totalcost" [] empty means that
    its not distinct or select all project,and -1 means that there is no limit used in the query.
    
    The difference is that now the code is valid clojur code,because the ?meal became "?meal".
    which is a valid cloure string. 
    Everything now is valid clojure code.They are vectors/maps with members valid clorure code. 
  
    As we said before macroq does 2 things
        produce valid clojure code
        make basic processing on the query

    For example here 
    <div class="code">
    (:meal.type ?meal "dinner")
    (:meal.name ?meal ?name)
    (:meal.cost ?meal ?cost)
    ((* ?cost 0.1)    ?tip)
    ((+ ?cost ?tip)   ?totalcost)
    (<= ?totalcost 20)
 </div>
    Became
    <div class="code">
    [["__and__" [1 :meal.cost "?meal" "?cost"]
                [1 :meal.type "?meal" "dinner"]
                [1 :meal.name "?meal" "?name"]
                [2 "tip" "(* \"?cost\"  0.1)"]
                [2 "totalcost" "(+ \"?cost\"  \"?tip\" )"]
                [3 "(<= \"?totalcost\"  20)"]]
</div> 

    What it did here
        1. ?var -> "?var" => valid clojure string
      
        2. The 1,2,3 in front of the queries shows the type of the query
           1=relation
           2=bind
           3=filter
      
        3. Added the missing operator and=join,here is not important because from above the empty
           table is coming but in another query a normal table might be coming from above
      
        4. Also processed the project
       
       The basic function that q macro calls and does that (make symbols strings/add 1,2,3 to queries etc)
       is   (louna.louna-process/add-str-group group) ,its a recursive functions that passes the
       query add operators when missing,make arguments strings,add the type of the query etc.
  
    Also the project is made a unary table operator.

    After the complile where the user wrote 
    (q ...)
    will be replaced with
    (run-q ...)

    So it is like the programmer wrote the code
    <div class="code">
    (run-q {}
           {:q-in [menuDB], :q-out ["print"]}
           [["__and__" [1 :meal.cost "?meal" "?cost"]
                       [1 :meal.type "?meal" "dinner"]
                       [1 :meal.name "?meal" "?name"]
                       [2 "tip" "(* \"?cost\"  0.1)"]
                       [2 "totalcost" "(+ \"?cost\"  \"?tip\" )"]
                       [3 "(<= \"?totalcost\"  20)"]]
            ["__project__" ["name" "totalcost"] [] -1]]
           {})
</div>

    run-q is a normal clojure function and this is a normal call of that function that will run at runtime

    *macroq does many more things in more complicated queries,but here the example is simple
     what else it does is explained briefly on packages/source files documentation on internals

(defn run-q [undefined settings group constructs])  louna.louna.clj:54
    run-q is calling everything needed to answer the query

    <div class="code">
    Undefined  is {} as we said,no clojure vars "undefined" symbols in 
    the query.

    The settings are
        {:q-in [menuDB], :q-out ["print"]}

    The group is the   
    [["__and__" [1 :meal.cost "?meal" "?cost"]
                [1 :meal.type "?meal" "dinner"]
                [1 :meal.name "?meal" "?name"]
                [2 "tip" "(* \"?cost\"  0.1)"]
                [2 "totalcost" "(+ \"?cost\"  \"?tip\" )"]
                [3 "(<= \"?totalcost\"  20)"]]

    constructs are {},because we don't have nested constructs in the query. 
 
</div>

    1. determine the q-in
    
        db (macroq.q-process/get-db settings)
        q-in-constructs (macroq.q-process/get-c-in-constructs settings)
        constructs (louna.louna-util/merge-relations q-in-constructs constructs)

        constructs here means that in-memory database,menuDB
        louna can query many in memoryDB in the same time,but before it merges
        them to a single database(merge ta maps)
  
       Here we don't query a file database,if we queried a file database
       we would give the directory of the database.

    2. determine the q-out
    
       q-out (get settings :q-out [])
       file-out (first (filter #(not= % "print") q-out))

    3. collect all the query information on a map
       
       q-info (macroq.q-process/get-q-info db constructs)

       In our example is almost empty because the database is in memory
       if it was a file database,the location would be stored,also the
       database statistics would be loaded (the size of the relations)

    4. start aswering the query
 
       table-info (groups.group-run/run-group q-info group)
    
    5. when we have the table do what q-out said,here we will only print
       the results
 
       Alternative we could have saved the result to a file table

    We care about this call
    table-info (groups.group-run/run-group q-info group)
    

<b>(defn run-group [q-id group])  groups.group-run/run-group:23  </b>

  For louna it is
  (project (join empty_table BGP))

  With BGP
  <div class="code">
    (:meal.type ?meal "dinner")
    (:meal.name ?meal ?name)
    (:meal.cost ?meal ?cost)
    ((* ?cost 0.1)    ?tip)
    ((+ ?cost ?tip)   ?totalcost)
    (<= ?totalcost 20)

 </div>
     
   We will not focus on run-group now,after all this example is only
   1 BGP and 1 project not many group operations.
   More about run-group in Groups on internal documentation.
   
   Inside the run-group function

<div class="code">
   (if (library.util/basic-pattern? cur-group)
          (recur (rest groups)
                 (bgp.bgp-process/process-bgp q-info cur-group))

</div>   

   The BGP above will be recognised as a basic-pattern and process-bgp
   will be called

   In the end after process-bgp return the table run-group will call
   the project operator,more on this later when we return 
    

<b>(bgp.bgp-process/process-bgp q-info queries))  bgp.bgp-process:54</b>

    This function doen't do alot,it does more if property paths are used
    but here it only separates the queries of the BGP in 3 categories 
        relational-queries 
        bind-queries 
        filter-queries 

    When done it calls the run-bgp

    (bgp.bgp-run/run-bgp   q-info
                           relational-queries
                           bind-queries
                           filter-queries)

<b>(defn run-bgp [q-info relation-queries bind-queries filter-queries])  bgp.bgp-run:12</b>

    In our example the arguments are
<div class="code">
    Relation-queries
      
        [(:meal.cost "?meal" "?cost")
         (:meal.type "?meal" "dinner")
         (:meal.name "?meal" "?name")]
  
     Bind-queries
         
        [["tip" "(* \"?cost\"  0.1)"]
         ["totalcost" "(+ \"?cost\"  \"?tip\" )"]]
  
     Filter-queries
        ["(<= \"?totalcost\"  20)"]

</div>    
    The example here is small,its not like the one in the query-plan example.
    So this example dont really need every function in the run-bgp.

    But i will explain what the function does even if here its not used
  
    table-info is the structure that hold the data of the BGP.
  
    The BGP will be processed alot,to find out what variables the filter needs,
    what variables the binds needs,what filter a relation needs to run when
    its been read etc
  
    Before we start lets say,from the query-plan tutorial there are
    Type of relations
    1)relations that init the table
    2)relations that add-vars to the table(cause join)
    3)relations that filter the table(dont add variable)

    Type of binds
    1)bind on relation var
    2)bind on bind

    Type of filters
    1)relation filter
      applied when reading a relation like from a file.
    2)bind filter
      applied when we calculate the value of the bind.
    3)table filter
      applied when we are making the joins

    run-bgp needs to guther enough information about the triples/filters/binds
    so the query plan can be made,for example which filter apply to which triple 

    <b>Init table info,just the queries</b>
    <div class="code">
      table-info {"relation-queries" relation-queries
                  "bind-queries"     bind-queries
                  "filter-queries"   filter-queries}
   
      The map has only thee members

    </div>
    <b>Add information about the vars in the queries</b>
    table-info (bgp.relations-process/add-vars-info table-info)

    Information about the variables in the queries.For example which is bind vars.
    pairs= vars that belong in a relation like (:meal.name "?meal" "?name")

     *we need this information because if we find a filter on ?meal+?name we know
      that the filter is a relation filter,a filter that its being read while a 
      relation its being read.This information will be used later from the query plan

    <div class="code">
    table-info 
    {"relation-queries" relation-queries
     "bind-queries" bind-queries
     "filter-queries" filter-queries

     "pairs" 
     "triples"
     "vars"      
     "bind-vars" bind-vars}
    </div>

     
    <b>Separate filters,now we have the information about vars we are ready to separate the filters</b>

    table-info (bgp.filters-process/seperate-filters table-info)

    <div class="code">
    table info
    {"relation-queries" relation-queries
     "bind-queries" bind-queries

     "vars-filter-functions"
     "table-filter-queries"

     "vars" vars
     "bind-vars" bind-vars}

     </div> 
    filter-queries replaced with 
        "vars-filter-functions"
        "table-filter-queries"

    vars-filter-functions = filters that are applied when reading a relationship/or add a bind var
    table-filter-queries  = filters that are applied when i make a join

    The difference is when they are applied if you need a join to apply it then its table filter
    for example
<div class="code">
    (:ab.firstName  ?person  ?firstName)
    (:ab.lastName            ?lastName)
    
    (and (= ?person :ab.i0432) (= ?lastName "Mutt"))      ;;var-filter
    (and (= ?firstName "Richard") (= ?lastName "Mutt"))   ;;table filter
</div>
    The join will trigger the table filter,but the first filter we can apply it while reading
    the relation (:ab.lastName  ?person ?lastName)
    For the second we fist join and then apply it.

    The same is for binds
<div class="code"> 
    ((+ ?cost ?tip)   ?totalcost)
    (<= ?totalcost 20)
</div>

    We don't need a join to apply this filter,we only need the bind,that's why in the query plans
    the var-filter-functions are embeded inside the relations and in the binds.    
    
   <b>Add binds</b>

   table-info (bgp.binds-process/add-binds table-info)

<div class="code">
   {"relation-queries" relation-queries
    "binds" binds

    "vars-filter-functions"
    "table-filter-queries"

    "vars" vars
    "bind-vars" bind-vars}
</div>
         
     Here binds are processed
     Binds must be applied when we have all the dep-vars

     Lets see the  binds map in our example
     We have 2 binds,lets focus on the second because it has a fitler also
<div class="code">
     [{"bind-var" "tip",
       "index" 0,
       "dep-vars" #{"cost"},
       "relation-dep-vars" #{"cost"},
       "f-map" {"f-args" ["cost"],
                "f-eval" #object[documentation.internals$eval5739$fn.."],          
                 "query" "(* ?cost  0.1)"},
       "filters" ()}
   
       {"bind-var" "totalcost",
        "index" 1,
        "dep-vars" #{"tip" "cost"},
        "relation-dep-vars" #{"cost"},
        "f-map" {"f-args" ["tip" "cost"], 
                 "f-eval" #object[documentation.internals$eval5743$fn..."],
                 "query" "(+ ?cost  ?tip )"},
        "filters" ({"f-args" ["totalcost"],
                    "f-eval" #object[documentation.internals$eval5747$fn"],
                    "query" "(<= ?totalcost  20)"})}]


     The second map describes this bind
     [2 "totalcost" "(+ \"?cost\"  \"?tip\" )"]
     [3 "(<= \"?totalcost\"  20)"]

</div>
    
     bind-var which var it adds
     index = it was the second bind in query,binds in the query must use variables that are defined above
     dep-vars = which vars i need to run the bind
     relation-dep-vars = which relation vars i need to run the bind (tip is not a relation var is a bind var)
     f-map is kinda of complicated for more information internal Functions in queries,its the function that will be
     evaluated to run the bind(lets say its the bind-function)
     filters= the filters that will be run when the bind will run(embebed in the bind,to run it we only need the bind)
   
     All this information will be used to determine the query plan,for example you can't try to run the filter 
     (<= ?totalcost  20) if you don't have the ?totalcost variable on the table. 

    <b>Process relations(the triples)</b>
    From above the filters embebed into the binds,now its time for binds
    to be embeded inside the relations.

<div class="codelong">

    Relations is a vector of maps , each map is a relation

<div class="code">
    relation            = {"query" query
                          "type" "s/o/so/rso/rs/ro/r"   
                          "relation" relation
                          "s-var/o-var/pair/triple"
                          "filters" {}
                          "vars" #{}}

   table info
   { "relations" relations
     "binds" binds
     "table-filter-queries" []}
</div>
     

  Lets see in our example the relation vector,we had 3
<div class="codelong">
  [1 :meal.cost "?meal" "?cost"]
  [1 :meal.type "?meal" "dinner"]
  [1 :meal.name "?meal" "?name"]
  
  The relations are 
  [{"query" (:meal.cost "?meal" "?cost"),
    "rel-type" "so",
    "relation" :meal.cost,
    "pair" ["meal" "cost"],
    "filters" {},
    "vars" #{"meal" "cost"},
    "property" nil, 
    "cost" 6}

   {"query" (:meal.type "?meal" "dinner"),
    "rel-type" "s",
    "relation" :meal.type,
    "filters" {},
    "s-var" "meal", 
    "vars" #{"meal"},
    "property" nil,
    "cost" 6}

   {"query" (:meal.name "?meal" "?name"),   ;;the query as give by the user
    "rel-type" "so",                        ;;query vars are the subject and the object
    "relation" :meal.name,                  ;;relation-name
    "pair" ["meal" "name"],                 ;;ordered the query vars
    "filters" {},                           ;;empty filtes query vars dont have a filter in the query
    "vars" #{"meal" "name"},                ;;vars of the query in set
    "property" nil,                         ;;its not a property path 
    "cost" 6}                               ;;it has 6 lines ,used in query plan later
   ]
</div>
  
   The example is simple we dont have filters on the vars of relations.
   See the comments on the last one.



  <b>Then we are ready to make the query plan</b>
     The query plan will be,refer to it while reading the steps below.
<div class="codelong">
     Query plan
        relation: (:meal.cost ?meal ?cost) join-vars: [] add-vars: [meal cost]
          bind: ( (* ?cost  0.1) ?tip )
          bind: ( (+ ?cost  ?tip ) ?totalcost )
                (<= ?totalcost  20)
          relation(filter): (:meal.type ?meal dinner) filter-vars [meal]
        relation: (:meal.name ?meal ?name) join-vars: [meal] add-vars: [name]
</div>
    
     The query plan is made in steps

        <b>Find the join ordering ignoring the binds initially</b>
           (bgp.joins-process/order-queries (state.state/get-db q-id) table-info)
        
        order the queries based on cost and then re-order them only to avoid cartesian join
        (i will make an extra tutorial for this)
        after that we have the order of joins,so we have the order of the tables in the final table

        In our example(here we are ignoring the binds at first)

        Query plan
        relation: (:meal.cost ?meal ?cost) join-vars: [] add-vars: [meal cost]
          relation(filter): (:meal.type ?meal "dinner") filter-vars [meal]
        relation: (:meal.name ?meal ?name) join-vars: [meal] add-vars: [name]

        If you see the relation (:meal.type ?meal "dinner") don't cause a join
        its only a filter relation,and it belongs to the relations that causes 
        the join that she needs to filter,thats why she is embeded to that relation.
   
        And the final table will have header as seen from the query plan
        [meal cost name]

        relation(filter) is as discussed a relation that dont adds a new-var to
        the table,so it only filters the table
  
        <b>From the previous we have for every bind the dependancy-vars of the bind
           now we have the sorted-vars of the final table so we add the binds </b>
    
        (bgp.binds-process/add-bind-vars-to-sorted-vars table-info)
 
        Now the sorted-vars with the binds(the header of the final table is ready)
        ["meal" "cost" "tip" "totalcost" "name"]
 
        <b>Add trigger vars to binds</b>

        (bgp.binds-process/add-trigger-var-to-binds table-info)

        If we remember the map of bind ((+ ?cost ?tip)   ?totalcost)

        {"bind-var" "totalcost",
        "index" 1,
        "dep-vars" #{"tip" "cost"},
        "relation-dep-vars" #{"cost"},
        "f-map" {"f-args" ["tip" "cost"], 
                 "f-eval" #object[documentation.internals$eval5743$fn..."],
                 "query" "(+ ?cost  ?tip )"},
        "filters" ({"f-args" ["totalcost"],
                    "f-eval" #object[documentation.internals$eval5747$fn"],
                    "query" "(<= ?totalcost  20)"})}]

        We see that "relation-dep-vars" #{"cost"},that means that from relation-vars(not bind-vars)
        we only need "cost",here the example is simple but maybe a bind needed like 4 relation-vars
        which would be the "trigger-var" of the bind?The last on based on the ordering of the sorted-vars
        ["meal" "cost" "tip" "totalcost" "name"]
 
        Here when we have cost we are ready to apply the bind,because cost=>tip and cost,tip => the bind we want.
        So the trigger var is cost.

        Now we are ready to embed the binds to the relations also.
        (a bind has maybe filters
         a relation has maybe filter
         and maybe binds)        

        <b>Embeded the binds to the relations,the bind belong to the relation that adds his trigger var to the table</b>
          (bgp.binds-process/add-binds-to-relations table-info)  
    
        And now we have the final query plan
  
        Query plan
        relation: (:meal.cost ?meal ?cost) join-vars: [] add-vars: [meal cost]
          bind: ( (* ?cost  0.1) ?tip )
          bind: ( (+ ?cost  ?tip ) ?totalcost )
                (<= ?totalcost  20)
          relation(filter): (:meal.type ?meal dinner) filter-vars [meal]
        relation: (:meal.name ?meal ?name) join-vars: [meal] add-vars: [name]

 
        Those 2 binds belongs to the join that adds the cost var that they needed
        so they belong to the relation that adds that var

        Printing the relations dont help,because they are complicated maps now
        They have so many information on them.
        But to make it simple

        filters got into   relations+binds  (based on what variables they need)
        binds  got into    relations        (based on when the bind-var will be added,for totalcost,the parent relation is the (:meal.cost ?meal ?cost) 
                                            which adds his trigger var to the table)

        All this processing to make the query plan is very fast,because the queries are so small.
        Alot is done but its like processing vectors with 10-20 members,its very fast.

        <b>Table filters(join filters)</b>
        Now we have the final query plan,the only thing missing is the table filters or else the
        filters that are applied when we make a join.
        Here we dont have any,in the previous example in the query plan we had.
        This function does that,the trigger var of the filter is the last dependency var it has based on the join ordering

        (bgp.filters-process/add-trigger-var-to-table-filters table-info)

  <b>Init table</b>
     Join method 2.     

    Process done
    We are ready to actually run the query plan

    (bgp-joins-disk.joins-run/init-table q-id table-info)

    Init table run the first relation and initialize the table here it runs the 
     relation: (:meal.cost ?meal ?cost) join-vars: [] add-vars: [meal cost]
      bind: ( (* ?cost  0.1) ?tip )
      bind: ( (+ ?cost  ?tip ) ?totalcost )
        (<= ?totalcost  20)
      relation(filter): (:meal.type ?meal dinner) filter-vars [meal]

    The first relation,and while it make a line,it will add to the line the tip bind then the totalcost bind,then apply the filter
    and if everything is ok,and also the line passes the relation(filter) it adds the table.

    relation(filter)=relation that dont add var to the table,its like a filter,but its a relation,here it enforces ?meal to be a dinner

    For example for us here the init-table is
    header =  "sorted-vars" = ["meal" "cost" "tip" "totalcost"]
    lines =   "table"       =  {3 [6 12 1.2000000000000002 13.2]} 

    6 is the meal id
    12 is the cost
    1.2 the tip
    13.2 the totalcost

   <b>Make the joins</b>

    Join method 2 .

    (bgp-joins-disk.joins-run/make-joins q-id table-info)

    Here based on the query plan we have only 1 join 

    relation: (:meal.name ?meal ?name) join-vars: [meal] add-vars: [name]

    This causes the (:meal.name ?meal ?name) to be read as a hash-table with key the var meal
    the join is made and the name is added in the table

    After the join the final table is
    table-info={"sorted-vars" ["meal" "cost" "tip" "totalcost" "name"]
                "table" {4 [6 12 1.2000000000000002 13.2 "pizza"]}

    The table is a hash map,the 4 here is the lineID,the reason that i made the table a hash table
    is because while filtering lines are deleted,and to delete a key in hash table is easy.

    The table here has only 1 line

    We have finally the table from the BGP and we return to the caller run-group , which returns to
    the caller run-q.

    *More about how the joins are made in Internals/joins.

<b>Project table</b>
    We are finally back to caller which was groups.group_run
   
    From the start the group was

<div class="code">
    [["__and__" [1 :meal.cost "?meal" "?cost"]
                [1 :meal.type "?meal" "dinner"]
                [1 :meal.name "?meal" "?name"]
                [2 "tip" "(* \"?cost\"  0.1)"]
                [2 "totalcost" "(+ \"?cost\"  \"?tip\" )"]
                [3 "(<= \"?totalcost\"  20)"]]
     ["__project__" ["name" "totalcost"] [] -1]]

</div>
    (project (empty_table :and BGP))   (project the vars ["name" "totalcost"])

    Now we have the table and we run the table operator project,run-group calls it
    with this code  group.group_run:78
<div class="code">
    (= operator "__project__")
    (let [project-vars (first new-group)
          project-options (into #{} (second new-group))
          limit (peek new-group)]
          (recur (rest groups) (groups.table-unary-op/project-table table project-vars project-options limit)))
</div>

    After the project we have the final table
<div class="code">
    {"sorted-vars" ["name" "totalcost"],
     "sorted?" false,
     "table" {0 ["pizza" 13.2]}}
</div>

<b>Print/store results</b>
  
  We are back in louna.louna  function=q-run   
  
  {:q-in [menuDB], :q-out ["print"]}

  This meant that the db to query was the in memory db menuDB 
  and we want to print the result in stdout

  so run-q now runs print-table
<div class="code">
  table-info (groups.group-run/run-group q-info group)
  print? (contains? (into #{} q-out) "print")
  file-out (first (filter #(not= % "print") q-out))
  - (if print? (library.print-data/print-table-stdout table-info)) 
  - (if-not (nil? file-out)
      (library.print-data/print-table-to-file
        (get table-info "sorted-vars")
        (get table-info "table") file-out))
</div>

  Here print? is true
  And file-out is nil,because we will not save the result in a table
  
  so only this will run 
  (library.print-data/print-table-stdout table-info)
  That will print the table to stdout

7)Finally we get in the std-out
  
  [name totalcost]
   "pizza" 13.2

*The BGP here is simple,it doesnt use many things like table filters,complicated triples with like (?r ?s ?o) or property paths
 but still explains enough the series of operations to calculate it.
