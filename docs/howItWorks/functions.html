<div id="main">
<h5 class = "main-title">Functions in queries</h5>
  <pre>

Louna uses functions inside the queries.
Here is explained how this works.

There is a source file that makes almost all the work needed.
bgp.functions-process.clj

Clojure functions can be used in filters or binds,it doesn't make any
difference,its the same code,just in case of a bind the result is stored
in a variable.The work the same way.

<div class="code">
(q {:q-in [menuDB] :q-out ["print"]}
   (:meal.cost ?meal ?cost)
   ((* ?cost 0.1)    ?tip)
   (< (+ ?cost ?tip) 20))

</div>
We will focus only in the filter function  (< (+ ?cost ?tip) 20)) 

Steps (in the middle there is the function that does the transformation)

    qmacro.q_processs/(defn add-str-group [group])
<div class="code">

        (< (+ ?cost ?tip) 20)
  
        =>        
  
       "(< (+ \"?cost\"  \"?tip\" ) 20)"  

</div>        
    bgp.functions-process/(defn get-vars-filter-function [filter-query])
<div class="code">

        "(< (+ \"?cost\"  \"?tip\" ) 20)" 
  
        =>

        ["(< (+ " "cost" "  " "tip" " ) 20)"]  

</div>
        This is a vector,in odd positions there are the query vars,and in even
        positions there are the rest of the function. 

        Now we are ready to use the function.
        If from a table line we had   [... ?cost ?tip ....]      
        {cost=50,tip=100}
        we know that in odd places there are the vars,so we take values from the map

<div class="code">
               
        ["(< (+ " "cost" "  " "tip" " ) 20)"]   
        ["(< (+ " "50" "  " "100" " ) 20)"]    ;;values from the map,of odd indexes 
        "(< (+ 50 100) 20)"                    ;;concat (apply str vector) in clojure
        (eval (read-string "(< (+ 50 100) 20)")) 
        result=true/false => keep or discard the line
</div>
  
        At first in louna this was the way it was working,i knew that this was not 
        fast because from every value from line,we had to replace the odd indexes,
        concat and the read-string and eval,but it was a first step and it was working.

    Before explaining more some things about read-string and eval.
        read-string => reads a string and produces clojure code for example (read-string "{:a [1 2]}")
                       will be a map containing a vector with member 1,2 and key of map :a
        eval => evaluates an expression for example  (eval (list + 1 2)) => (+ 1 2) = 3
                the argument of eval will be evaluated (list + 1 2) produce (+ 1 2) 
                (like normal function argument before call) and eval will make it 3

        Eval and local/global variables
            Eval can see global variables for example,this works
                (def t 10)
                (eval (read-string "(+ t 10)"))
            Eval can't see local variables for example this doesn't work
                (let [t 10]
                  (eval (read-string "(+ t 10)")))  

    Use only eval for each line
        What was the steps for every line from first try
            replace the values from the map
            concat the string
            read string
            eval

        I thought of a way to remove the first 3 steps for each line,and do it only once for each function and not for each line.
        The idea was to put the values in a global map(so eval could have access) with state(a clojure atom).    
<div class="code">

        ["(< (+ " "cost" "  " "tip" " ) 20)"] 
        =>
        (< (+ (state.state/get-value 2) (state.state/get-value 3)) 20)     {"cost" [2], "tip" [3]}
</div>
        We are ready to take a line,and run the filter
        from line to value map,from value map to filter function and eval

<div class="code">

        if in line {cost 50 tip 100} => 
        global value-map {2 50
                         3 100}
   
        (eval (< (+ (state.state/get-value 2) (state.state/get-value 3)) 20))

        if next line is {cost 30 tip 50}
        global value-map {2 30
                         3 50}
 
        (eval (< (+ (state.state/get-value 2) (state.state/get-value 3)) 20))  

</div>    
        What we gained?
        For each line we only do eval
        Replace the values from the map/concat the string/read string are done only 1 time for each function
        not for every line. 

        That was the second try and it worked.
        Unfortunately this is slow also.
        I din't know it until i made a bigger benchmark 10000 rows and like 10 joins.

        Even if we escaped read-string,and needed only eval,its still slow.
        The reason has to do with the compiler,the function here everytime will be evaluated
        but normally the function would be evaluated once(produce compiled code of the function)
        and then only run it.Here we "re-compile" the function in each call.
        
    In louna now,functions are run like this
<div class="code">

        (< (+ ?cost ?tip) 20) 
        "(< (+ \"?cost\"  \"?tip\" ) 20)" 
        ["(< (+ " "cost" "  " "tip" " ) 20)"]    
        (fn [cost tip] (< (+ cost tip) 20))      

</div>
        Each filter now becomes a normal clojure function and its evaluated as a function.
         
        We take the query-vars (odds positions in vector)
        We put them in a set #{"cost" "tip"}
        We make them a vector f-args=["cost" "tip"]
        f-body = (apply str f-vector)  = "(< (+ cost tip) 20)"
        Then we make a unmamed function as a string
        (str "(fn " (into [] (map symbol f-args)) f-body ")")

        This is the string  "(fn [cost tip] (< (+ cost tip) 20))"
  
        Then my_filter = (eval (read-string "(fn [cost tip] (< (+ cost tip) 20))"))
        And we have a clojure function,ready to be called like a normal function

        if line is {cost 30 tip 50}
        we call (my_filter 30 50)

        We still use eval,but now we use it to evaluate the function and its done only 1
        time,and not eval in every call.
        For every line we just call a normal clojure function.(that we evaluated before 1 time)
 
        The function that does that
<div class="code">

        (defn vector-to-function [f-vector]
          (let [f-args (into [] (get-vector-vars f-vector))
                f-body (apply str f-vector)
                f-eval (eval (read-string (str "(fn " (into [] (map symbol f-args)) f-body ")")))]
            [f-args f-eval]))
</div>
        This works and its fast filter became a normal clojure function,that we just call.

<b>Local arguments</b>
   For example
<div class="code">

   (defn f [euro]
    (q {:q-in [menuDB] :q-out ["print"]}
       (:meal.cost ?meal ?cost)
       ((* ?cost 0.1)    ?tip)
       (< (+ ?cost ?tip) euro)))
   
</div>
   The second solution that failed because was slow for each line works fine for that.
   Because you only do the 3 steps 1 time for the filter.
   euro has one value,the value that f has argument.

   q macro will produce this
<div class="code">

   (run-q {2 {"euro" euro}} 
          {:q-in [menuDB], :q-out ["print"]}
          [["__and__" [1 :meal.cost "?meal" "?cost"]
                      [2 "tip" "(* \"?cost\"  0.1)"]
                      [3 "(< (+ \"?cost\"  \"?tip\" ) euro)_2"]]
           ["__project__" [] [:all] -1]] 
          {})

</div>
   To see the code that will be generated after compile(expand the macro)

<div class="code">

   (defn f [euro]
    (run-q {2 {"euro" euro}} 
          {:q-in [menuDB], :q-out ["print"]}
          [["__and__" [1 :meal.cost "?meal" "?cost"]
                      [2 "tip" "(* \"?cost\"  0.1)"]
                      [3 "(< (+ \"?cost\"  \"?tip\" ) euro)_2"]]
           ["__project__" [] [:all] -1]] 
          {}))

</div>     
    euro is just a variable but we have a problem
    this {2 {"euro" euro}}  gets the euro value
    but this "(< (+ \"?cost\"  \"?tip\" ) euro)_2" does not get it because euro
    is inside a string but it has _2,that says how to get it from the global map
  
    {2 {"euro" euro}}  is added to the global map(clojure atom)
    So we have the value of euro stored
    
    bgp.functions-process/(defn add-locals-to-code [code-str])
    Is the function that does that
    "Filter before" "(< (+ \"?cost\"  \"?tip\" ) euro)_2"
    "Filter after" "(< (+ \"?cost\"  \"?tip\" )  (get-in @state.state/undefined [2 \"euro\"] ))"

     (get-in @state.state/undefined [2 \"euro\"]) means,get into the global map first key=2,second="euro"
     this way we can get the euro value from the global map when we eval the filter
 
    I could do it like the way we did with functions,to reduce complexity,but it worked even with the
    old way and didn't cause any perfomance problems,because euro has only 1 value.

    With an example its more clear
    Lets say we called 
<div class="code">

    (f 10)
    
    (defn f [10]
     (run-q {2 {"euro" 10}} 
          {:q-in [menuDB], :q-out ["print"]}
          [["__and__" [1 :meal.cost "?meal" "?cost"]
                      [2 "tip" "(* \"?cost\"  0.1)"]
                      [3 "(< (+ \"?cost\"  \"?tip\" ) euro)_2"]]
           ["__project__" [] [:all] -1]] 
          {}))

</div>    
    In the global map the 10 will be stored as value of euro.
    {2 {"euro" 10}} 

    Here euro is inside the string,but we have _2
    "(< (+ \"?cost\"  \"?tip\" ) euro)_2"
    
    So we know that we need 2 key in the global map (get-in @state.state/undefined [2 "euro"] )
    The above can be re-writen like 
    "(< (+ \"?cost\"  \"?tip\" ) (get-in @state.state/undefined [2 "euro"] ))"
    And now we are done ready to use the filter and make it a normal clojure function like above.
