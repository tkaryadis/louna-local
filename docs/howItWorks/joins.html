<b>Join methods</b>

    All Louna joins are hash-joins.
    Louna has 2 methods for joining.
        table on memory on hash-table
        relation on memory on hash-table

    *relation we mean named pairs,    :name.attribute [[id,value] ....]   

<b>Example that will be used</b>
   Its the query plan from Internals/query plan without the filters.

<div class="codelong">
relation: (:ab.city ?address ?city) join-vars: [] add-vars: [city address]
relation: (:ab.streetAddress ?address ?streetAddress) join-vars: [address] add-vars: [streetAddress]
relation: (:ab.region ?address ?region) join-vars: [address] add-vars: [region]
relation: (:ab.address ?person ?address) join-vars: [address] add-vars: [person]
relation: (:ab.firstName ?person ?firstName) join-vars: [person] add-vars: [firstName]
relation: (:ab.lastName ?person ?lastName) join-vars: [person] add-vars: [lastName]
relation: (:ab.postalCode ?address ?postalCode) join-vars: [address] add-vars: [postalCode]
relation(filter): (:ab.postalCode ?address ?postalCode) filter-vars [postalCode address]

</div>

<b>Join method 1</b>
   package joins

   Intermediate results(table) on memory in hash-table,with keys the next join vars.
   Relation read line by line.

   Louna uses the query plan to make the joins,so in every join we make we know what the next join will be.

   1)Relation 1 (inits the table)
     read the relation (:ab.city ?address ?city) 
     see the next join-vars [address]

     read a line,apply filters/binds on line(here we dont have),and store the line in hash-table with 
     key = address

     Do that for each line,in the end we will have a hash-table in memory {[?address] [?city ?address]}

   2)Relation 2
   
     current-join-vars  [address]
     next-join-vars     [address]
 
     Read 1 line of (:ab.streetAddress ?address ?streetAddress),make the join if join succeded and all 
     filter/binds etc succeded,the line will be stored in the new hash-table {[?address] [?city ?address ?streetAddress]}

     We do that for each line and in the end we have {[?address] [?city ?address ?streetAddress]} in memory

     .....
     .....
   
   7)Relation 7
     (:ab.postalCode ?address ?postalCode) join-vars: [address] add-vars: [postalCode]
  
     Hash-table on memory:
     We have in memory the table ([?address] [?city ?address ?streetAddress ?region ?person ?firstName ?lastName])

     Next join-vars(here filter-vars): [postalCode address]
     
     We will make the join with (:ab.postalCode ?address ?postalCode) on ?address and the result will be saved
     in a hash-table 
     {[?postalCode ?address]  [?city ?address ?streetAddress ?region ?person ?firstName ?lastName ?postalCode]}  

   8)Relation 8
 
     Hash-table on memory:
     {[?postalCode ?address]  [?city ?address ?streetAddress ?region ?person ?firstName ?lastName ?postalCode]}  

     Next join vars we dont have its the last relation.

     We read the filter relation (:ab.postalCode ?address ?postalCode) line by line,if a line join with the table
     on [?postalCode ?address],that means that all the lines with the specific values pass the relation filter
     so they can be saved in the result table

     Here we dont have next-join vars so no need for a hash-table ,we just make the table
     [?city ?address ?streetAddress ?region ?person ?firstName ?lastName ?postalCode]

     We have the final table and joins are completed.

     
   Memory considerations 
     At every join we have in memory
     hash-table-join-vars(full) + 1 line of relation + hash-table-next-join-vars(under-construction)
   
     Clojure uses persistend data structures the lines of hash-table-next-join-vars is the lines
     of hash-table-join-vars + 1 or 2 more values.So we only need memory for 1 table because 
     persistend data structures share the common values.

     At least if i have understand it right.So in memory its like having only 1 hash-table.
   
   This method is good if the table results fits in memory but the relations don't fit.
   For example joining relations that few values are joined,or where many filters are applied,
   and temporally results are small.

   This way louna can query very big relations.   
  
<b>Join method 2</b>
   package join-disk

   Next relation in hash-table with keys the join attributes,table results read line by line
   and make the joins.

   This was the first method implemented.
   The reason is that the first method works based on query plan,at first there was no query
   plan,there was a defined sequence of joins but it was programmed in program logic,and it 
   wasn't so easy to think of next-join-vars etc.

   Also i knew from the start that i will need both(1 if relations are very big,and the second
   if results are very big(for example big header))

   We will use the same query plan but for method 2.

   1)Relation 1
     relation: (:ab.city ?address ?city) join-vars: [] add-vars: [city address]

     Becomes a table  [?address ?city]

   2)Relation 2

     Table in memory: (not-hash-table)
        [?address ?city]

     Next relation
        relation: (:ab.streetAddress ?address ?streetAddress) join-vars: [address] add-vars: [streetAddress]
        Becomes a hash-table with key=address  {[?address] [?address ?streetAddress]}

     We read the table in memory line by line and we make the join,the next table will be
        [?address ?city ?streetAddress]

   ....
   ....

   We do the same till the end the table(results) are read line by line and the relation is on hash-table.

   Materialization

     This method is usefull when table(intermediate results) are so big that can't be in memory,so materialization
     must be added to make it usefull.(table be in disk)

     I added materialization on constructs for example if they are getting big save in disk and continue.
 
     But in tables its not easy to add,because i have to change other operators also like sort-by,group-by etc.
     The method to make a join from disk is ready,but i dont have the other methods to do like a sort-by with
     table on disk.
   
     For now method 2,is also in memory.

   For some reason Method 2 is faster than Method 1,i expected Method 1 to be faster.The difference is like 20%.

   Property paths works only with Method 2.
   (set-join-method "disk")  = method 2
   (set-join-method "mem")   = method 1

<b>Temporary vars on Method join 1</b>

    Louna can take variables in 3 positions => there are many different types of relations
    rso,rs,ro,so,o,s

    rso => variables in 3 positions.

    At first i thought that i can make 

    (:person.name ?id "takis")  
    to 
    (?tempr ?id ?tempname)
    (= ?tempr :person.name)
    (= ?tempname "takis")

    Why i did't used that from the start
        1)i didn't even have filters implemented
        2)after i had filters but was very slow (see Functions on queries for the progress)
        3)there would have been problems with the temp-vars,that they should be detected and 
          removed and never enter the table results.
          (it would make it slower,and more memory would be needed)

    After join method 2 was completed , this introduced so much complexity and so much code needed.
    I found way to make filters fast,so i re-visited that alternative and used temp-vars.

    In join method 1,i use the second approach.With less code,and more simple implementation.
    In join method 1 there is only 1 type of relation   rso.

    (:person.name ?id "takis")  
    to 
    (?tempr ?id ?tempname)    ;;inside the code its  (?TTMP100 ?id ??TTMP101)
    (= ?tempr :person.name)
    (= ?tempname "takis")

    Also the filters are not even used,because if i see a ?temp-var i know there is a filter  (= ?tempvar "value")
    so i just take the "value" and while the relation is been read i say  (= ?tempvar "value").
    (i dont use the filters as functions at all)

<div class="codelong">
(if (= s s-val)
    (bgp.filters-run/run-vars-filters-vectors s-filters [s-var] [s]))
</div>

    If s-var was a temp-var i would have taken the s-value from the filter and i will not apply the filter,
    only a signle = operator will be applied.

    The filters are like normal functions in Louna now,but there was not even need to call that function.

    Also the second problem was how to deal with temp-vars that i dont want to get in the table.
    Temp vars are never join-vars,because they are not repeated in queries.Temp vars only have a filter.
    So while joining,temp-vars are always in add-vars(see plan above).When we make the join and construct
    the next hash-table,we dismiss the add-vars that are temp-vars.So temp-vars are only needed for the
    filter and never enter the results.

    Both problems solved.

    In all docs/internal the code is from Join method 2 without temp-vars,because temp-vars would make
    the explaining much more complicated,for no reason.
